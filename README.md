# Human-Activity-Classification-Using-Time-Series-Dataset
Classification of activities of humans based on time series obtained by a WirelessSensor Network.
1. Data source - WirelessSensor Network.
2. Dataset description - Time series activities for bending, cycling, lying, sitting, standing, and walking.
3. Feature description - Each file contains 6 time series collected from activitiesof the same person, which are called avgrss12, varrss12, avgrss13, varrss13,vgrss23, and arrss23. There are 88 instances in the dataset, each of which con-tains 6 time series and each time series has 480 consecutive values.
4. Models Built - Binary Classification and Multiple Classification.
5. Processes performed - Feature extraction and classification
